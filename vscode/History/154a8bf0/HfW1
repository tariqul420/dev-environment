refactor(theme): Simplify theme handling and mode toggle

- Removes the "system" theme option from the UI, making the `ModeToggle` component a direct light/dark switcher.
- Simplifies theme logic in `ClerkProvider` and `ToasterProvider` to reflect the removal of the "system" theme option.
- Enables the `richColors` prop on the `Toaster` component for more visually distinct toast notifications.
