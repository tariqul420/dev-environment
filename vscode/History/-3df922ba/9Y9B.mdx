# Domain DNS Transfer: Hostinger to Cloudflare (Next.js Friendly)

This guide will help you move your domain's DNS from Hostinger to Cloudflare, configure optimal SSL/TLS and performance settings, and ensure compatibility with modern applications.

## Benefits of Using Cloudflare DNS (Recommended)

| Feature                       | 🌩️ Cloudflare DNS      | Hostinger DNS        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Free SSL                      | ✅ Yes (Universal SSL) | ❌ No (manual setup) |
| DDOS Protection               | ✅ Built-in            | ❌ None              |
| CDN / Global Cache            | ✅ Enabled             | ❌ Not available     |
| IP Masking / Firewall         | ✅ Available           | ❌ No                |
| Auto Performance Optimization | ✅ Brotli, Minify      | ❌ Basic only        |
| DNS Propagation Speed         | ✅ Fast                | ❌ Slower            |
| Analytics and Rate Limiting   | ✅ Advanced            | ❌ Limited           |
| Best for SEO and Production   | ✅ Highly Recommended  | ❌ Not optimal       |

**Recommendation**: Always use Cloudflare DNS for production websites. It’s faster, more secure, and more reliable.

---

## 1. Create a Free Cloudflare Account

- Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com
- Sign up using your Gmail or email account

---

## 2. Add Your Site to Cloudflare

- Click "+ Add a Site"
- Enter your domain (e.g. naturalsefaa.com)
- Choose the Free Plan

---

## 3. Import or Configure DNS Records

Cloudflare will attempt to auto-import records from Hostinger. If not, add manually:

| Type | Name | Value    |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| A    | @    | VPS IPv4 |
| A    | www  | VPS IPv4 |
| AAAA | @    | VPS IPv6 |
| AAAA | www  | VPS IPv6 |

Make sure the Proxy status (orange cloud) is ON to enable Cloudflare protection.

---

## 4. Update Hostinger Nameservers

Cloudflare will provide nameservers like:

```
josh.ns.cloudflare.com
lola.ns.cloudflare.com
```

1. Login to Hostinger
2. Go to Domains > DNS / Nameservers
3. Select Custom Nameservers
4. Paste Cloudflare's nameservers
5. Save and wait for propagation (usually 15 minutes to 12 hours)

Check propagation using https://dnschecker.org

---

## 5. Remove Hostinger Default Nameservers

If your domain was using Hostinger’s default nameservers:

```
ns1.dns-parking.com
ns2.dns-parking.com
```

Make sure to remove these from your Hostinger domain panel and only use the nameservers provided by Cloudflare.

---

## 6. Configure SSL on Cloudflare

Go to SSL/TLS > Overview:

- SSL Mode: Full (strict)
- Always Use HTTPS: Enabled
- Automatic HTTPS Rewrites: Enabled
- TLS 1.3: Enabled
- Minimum TLS Version: 1.2

Note: If you're using Full (strict), your VPS must have Let's Encrypt or a valid SSL certificate installed.

---

## 7. Performance Optimization

Navigate to Speed > Optimization:

| Option                         | Status   |
| ------------------------------ | -------- |
| Auto Minify (HTML/CSS/JS)      | On       |
| Brotli Compression             | On       |
| Rocket Loader (JS Boost)       | Optional |
| Early Hints                    | Enabled  |
| Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization | On       |

---

## 8. Caching Configuration

Go to Caching > Configuration:

- Browser Cache TTL: 1 hour or 4 hours
- Always Online: Enabled
- Do not enable "Cache Everything" if your application uses SSR or ISR

Important for Next.js users: SSR/ISR depends on dynamic rendering. Avoid full-page caching to preserve reactivity.

---

## 9. Security Settings

Cloudflare > Security > Settings:

- DDoS Protection: Enabled
- Bot Fight Mode: Enabled
- IP Access Rules: Optional for geo-blocking

---

## 10. Verify DNS and Proxy Activation

Use the terminal:

```bash
dig yourdomain.com
```

The IP in the response should match a Cloudflare IP (e.g. 104.21.x.x), confirming that proxy is active.

---

## Notes for Next.js Users

- Compatible with App Router, SSG, SSR, and API routes
- Full (strict) SSL mode requires active SSL on your server
- Do not use "Cache Everything" page rules in Cloudflare if using dynamic rendering
- Cloudflare acts as a CDN, DDoS filter, and TLS endpoint. Your backend handles rendering

---

## Success!

Your domain is now:

- Accelerated with global CDN
- Protected by HTTPS and Cloudflare DDoS tools
- Optimized for performance and modern web app frameworks

You are ready to deploy confidently using Cloudflare and Next.js together.
